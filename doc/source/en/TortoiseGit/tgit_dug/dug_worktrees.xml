		A worktree can be seen as an additional checkout of a Git repository (cf. <gitdoclink cmd="user-manual" anchor="def_working_tree" />).

	<para>
		Use the
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>TortoiseGit</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Worktrees</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		option to manage worktrees.
		When selecting this option, a dialog pops up where all current worktrees are listed.

		The first entry is the main repository. It cannot be deleted because it contains the <filename>.git</filename>-folder with branches.
		All other worktrees use that <filename>.git</filename>-folder for book keeping.

		To remove/lock/unlock a worktree, <action>right-click</action> it and select the desired action.

		<title>Creating a worktree</title>
		<para>
			To create a new worktree, specify a folder. By default for the path the main repo path is selected.
			Modify that to your liking. For example from <filename>C:\Users\jdoe\TortoiseGit</filename> to <filename>C:\Users\jdoe\another-worktree</filename>.

			To specify which revision is checked out, select <guilabel>HEAD</guilabel>, a branch, tag, or a concrete commit.

			A branch can only be checked out at a single worktree.
			Alternatively use <guilabel>Force</guilabel> to check out the branch twice, but this is not recommended.
		</para>
		<para>
			Check <gitdoclink cmd="git-worktree" section="1"/> for further details.
